# Shell scripts

These are my shell scripts that I use on my Linux distros. Currently, they are configured for Fedora, but can be used on other distros as long as you have required dependencies.

TODO: 
- list requirements
- create the install.sh script for easy installation of all commands.

## Scripts

- v.sh: combines fd, fzf, fzf-tmux, tmux, and nvim to find all files in the current directory, type the filename in the search field, and open it with nvim. Usage: `v`
